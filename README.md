Mission: Set up a dev environment for the Ethereum blockchain to develop my first smart contract by using web3 JS, Truffle JS, and Ganache.

Smart Contract Purpose:
- Create a ERC721 smart contract for our Date token where token name is 'Date' and token symbol is 'DATE'.
- We want user to be able to add a title to each Date token.
- We want to store the year, month, day, title, and color on the blockchain.

Development Cycle of our Smart Contract:
- We will implement a function. 
- We will implement a unit test to make sure our function works properly. Truffle JS comes with a testing framework which will make sure our smart contract works before it gets deployed.
